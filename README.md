# Warm up Theme

## A bit different Theme, created from scratch

Thank you for your interest in the design. But what is so special about this design?

Most Designs are one in one color or so contrary, that I got problems with my eyes.

So I decidet to make a theme, wich is **easy to read**, **not to colorfull** and nevertheless **clearly designed with syntax highlighting**.

## Wich languages are supported?

I made this design for
- HTML
- Javascript
- Typescript
- CSS
- SCSS/SASS

But it should also work for other languages. Feel free, to write me, if you are still missing something.
